Supersingular Isogeny Key Encapsulation: SIKEp751 & SIKEp503
written in C language
=======================================================================
    
This software library contains faster software implementation of the SIKE protocol based on a new data representation for SIKEp503 and SIKEp751. They can be found under "/src/P503_uRadix" and "/src/P751_uRadix", where the files for finite field arithmetic computing is compiled as object files.
The referred implementations for SIKEp503 and SIKEp751 based on the Montgomery reduction are also attached. They are under "/src/P503_Mont" and "/src/P751_Mont". 
We can easily compare the two designs.

* SIKEp503: matching the post-quantum security of SHA3-256 (level 2).
* SIKEp751: matching the post-quantum security of AES256 (level 5).
